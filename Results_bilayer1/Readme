Attempt at achieving the bilayer configuration. Not quite. I get the bilayer, but havenâ€™t achieved the homogenous solvent the boundaries. Not sure what to do. Perhaps modifying the chemical potential would help. The chemical potential is currently set at zero for both - pushing some of the diblock out of the system could help.
