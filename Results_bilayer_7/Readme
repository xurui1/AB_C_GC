Fixed problem with initial conditions leading to solving the A vs. B concentration problem. Code converged. I’m having a problem with the initial condition though, that seems to affect the stability of the program, occasionally causing it to crash. Sometimes the concentration of phiC (homopolymer) for i=integer, and all j for that i is `stuck’ at zero, and lags behind. This sometimes causes the program to give Nan results. Currently, I’ve been running the program, checking phi, then if it looks ok then I’ve been allowing it to run to completion.
