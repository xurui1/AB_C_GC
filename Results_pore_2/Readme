Pore looks good. Reduced r length of box from 10 to 6 to prevent any diblock from creeping into the system where I don’t want it to. This data is from the ~6000th iteration, it didn’t seem to want to fully converge. Perhaps it’s not a particularly stable state. Pore location is (i=28,j=24). I don’t think that the A-block reaches zero concentration, so I might need to either change the location of the tip or increase the size of the box.
